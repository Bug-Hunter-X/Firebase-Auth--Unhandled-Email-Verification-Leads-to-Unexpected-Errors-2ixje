The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's email is not verified and you attempt to access user data without handling the `user.emailVerified` property.  This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior in your application.  For example, trying to access `user.uid` before checking `user.emailVerified` could result in an error if the email is not verified.
